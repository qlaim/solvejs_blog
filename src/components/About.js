        <h1>About SolveJS</h1>
        <p>SolveJS is one of my pet JavaScript projects being built to better understand how to build websites with JavaScript technologies. I want to continue my learning while helping other aspiring developers grow, too.
        </p>
        <p>Main technologies I will be working with will be HTML, CSS, JavaScript (makes sense), ReactJS, Express JS, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL to build websites. Other tools that will be used are Webpack, Git, Visual Studio Code, and others as we progress.</p>
        <p>Since this JavaScript website will be a continual work-in-progress, expect the content to add other relevant JavaScript-related technologies and tools over some time.  I'll make every attempt to explain the 'why' of new items if I feel that the content does not properly answer that question.</p>
        <p>I will always welcome feedback, criticism, and better solutions on this project.  I don't think I can increase my understandings without these.</p>
        <p>Okay, let's get <a href='/'>back to the blog</a> and figure some things out.</p>
